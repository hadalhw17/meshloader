This is a simple library to load .obj and .glTF meshes using latest C++20 standard

Its primary purpose is to simplify my life as well as build some other mesh tools using it

**Current plan**
- Mesh to SDF conversion
- Mesh optimisation, such as cache optimisation, vertex quantinization, etc

Feel free to blame me for my poor usage of C++))
